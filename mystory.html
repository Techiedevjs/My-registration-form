<h1> Hi, I am the Tech Nerd</h1>

<img src="profilepic.jpeg">

<h3> Ok, where do i start from? I started learning how to code a few years back, i think 2019 but got stuck at HTML then stooped. I only had videos, no proper guidance but now i decided to start coding because i want to be a solidity developer then here we are. 
<p> In 48 hours of learning HTML, here is what I have learnt so far </p> </h3>

You need to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/techiedevjs">Twitter</a> by the way.

<br>
<br>

<h3> This are the reasons why i want to learn <em> Solidity </em> </h3>
<ul>
	<li>I love the concept behind <strong>Web3</strong> </li>
	<li> I have been in the crypto space for over two years and come on, who does not love smart contracts? </li>
	<li> It is an opportunity to connect with more people </li>
</ul>
<br>

This is what i would like to achieve in a year
